# ungenotes
This project is aimed toward a nice, customized note editor for the german youtuber Unge.

## Development Quick start
To begin the development with this app, you need `node` and `yarn` installed.
Just checkout the repository, `cd` into the root project folder and run

```bash
   yarn install
```

This installs all the necessary dependencies.
Now, start the electron app with

```bash
    yarn start
```

That's it. Now, you can start editing the code, e.g. in _VS Code_ or _Webstorm_, and enjoy the live reloading.
